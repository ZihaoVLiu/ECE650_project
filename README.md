## This projec is to help the local polic department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.
By solving a optimization problem, calle the Vertex Cover problem, allows th polic to be able to minimize the number of cameras they nee to install, and still be effective as possible wit their monitoring.

- Designed a complete system to recommend the locations of monitors to cover all traffic intersections with minimum number of monitors, which supports adding/changing/removing streets operations and generating graph structure to provide the optimal solution.

- Integrated four modules working in order automatically as multiprocess with advanced Linux programming.

- Improved human-machine interface experience by increasing system error tolerance; promoted the efficiency of system test by building an extra random qualified streets generation system.

- Reduced running time sharply while reaching 90% accuracy on large input by trading off time complexity and approximation ratio through quantitative analysis of three different algorithms.
